My personal set of config files for vim & zsh

# Installation

Simply clone the repository, `cd` into the directory and run `./install-dotfiles.sh`. This will update all submodules, create symlinks and even set the necessary fonts for powerline (tested on OSX, Ubuntu and FreeBSD).

To fully utilize the installed powerline font (currently Source Code Pro), you have to adjust the selected font of your Terminal application. On OSX there are Terminal themes included for Solarized Dark and Light.
